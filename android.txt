ANDROID

Programs are written in Java but some of the project structure is XML, so you need to be familiar with both.
 - Not every Java library is available on Android. 

Programs contain ‘activities’ which you can think of as ‘pages’ to your app. Each activity is a ‘container’ for both the user interface and the code that runs it.

‘Fragments’ allow you to maximize real estate on a larger screen, like a tablet. Having two fragments is like having 2 activities on one screen.

‘Intents’ make up the core message system on Android. They are made up of (1) an action (e.g. view, edit, or dial) & (2) data that action might need (e.g. a phone number). Intents can open new activities in your app or they can open other apps.

‘Intents’ don’t work automatically - you have to register an ‘intent filter’ first. Sometimes an intent can be received by more than one application and you can give the user a choice. Think of when Youtube asks if you want to watch in the app or launch in the browser.

‘Views’ are the basic building blocks of the UI, much like paragraph <p> or anchor <a> tags in HTML. Common views you’ll see are TextView, ImageView, Layout, and Button.

Widgets and notifications may want to be programmed along with the application.

Hardware you can use in your app may include: (1) Accelerometer (measures acceleration, but also tells you if the phone is shaken, turned upside down, etc.) (2) Bluetooth Radio (tells you if a headset is connected (3) Compass (4) Camera (5) GPS receiver. You can also (if you wish) access the Contacts list on the phone.

Your UI can utilize more than just on-click. Think of all the possibilities with swipe, flip, drag, and pinch!

Androids source code is open source. 
 - Built on the open source Linux kernel; Java core libraries and Android Runtime frameworks, Open GL (Graphics Library), Webkit (promotes easier viewing of web pages), SQLite (database engine), media frameworks for audio & video, and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for internet security

API & SDK examples: https://developer.android.com/samples/
 - these will also help w/ notifications, alarms, intents, menus, search, preferences, & background services
